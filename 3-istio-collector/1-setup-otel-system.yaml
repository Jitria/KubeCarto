# Setup service for otel-collector, we need to make a service for
# letting Istio know that there actually is a service named otel-collector to export the
# OTEL logs from envoy to here.
# Istio currently supports exporting OTEL logs to only services registered in Istio,
# Other workaround will be using a ServiceEntry, but this is out of scope since we are just going to
# use services inside the Kubernetes cluster
