## Log Preprocessing:
Numbat preprocesses log data with the following goals:

- Parsing and Extraction: Extracts crucial information from log data and parses it into a structured format.
- Normalization: Standardizes log data formats for consistency and ease of subsequent analysis.


## API Metric Generation:
In the Numbat project, various metrics related to APIs are generated by API Classification.

- API Count per Destination: Statistics on the number of API calls for each destination.
- Usage Method Statistics per Destination: Statistics on methods used per destination.
- API Error Statistics: Statistics on API calls where errors occurred.
- API Average Latency Statistics: Statistics on the average response latency of API calls.
- Total API Statistics per Minute: Statistics on the total number of API calls per minute.

These metrics measure various aspects of API calls, and the data can be stored for future analysis.


## Exporting:
Numbat performs the following tasks to share or store generated log and metric data.

- Exporter Configuration: Configures settings based on the backend where log and metric data will be stored.
- Data Transmission: Transmits log and metric data to the configured exporting backend for storage or integration with other systems.
