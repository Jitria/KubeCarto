# Numbat : API Observability for 5G
[![Numbat Docker Build](https://github.com/boanlab/numbat/actions/workflows/numbat-docker-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/boanlab/numbat/actions/workflows/numbat-docker-build.yml) [![test-go](https://github.com/boanlab/numbat/actions/workflows/test-go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/boanlab/numbat/actions/workflows/test-go.yml)

Numbat efficiently preprocesses log data , produces API-related metrics, and performs additional exporting. Here's an overview:

![Numbat_Overview](docs/Numbat_Overview.png)

## Log Generation:
Numbat preprocesses log data with the following goals:

- Parsing and Extraction: Extracts crucial information from log data and parses it into a structured format.
- Normalization: Standardizes log data formats for consistency and ease of subsequent analysis.

## API Metric Generation:
In the Numbat project, various metrics related to APIs are generated by API Classification.
These metrics measure various aspects of API calls, and the data can be stored for future analysis.


## Exporting:
Numbat performs the following tasks to share or store generated log and metric data.

- Exporter Configuration: Configures settings based on the backend where log and metric data will be stored.
- Data Transmission: Transmits log and metric data to the configured exporting backend for storage or integration with other systems.
